# Text Analysis Mini Project
## About
This project takes the text on the user's clipboard and displays a graph showing the frequency of the top 10 most frequent terms in the text. It also prints out the sentiment analysis of the text, including both the polarity and the subjectivity.

Note this project can be used in conjunction with the WordCounts mini project for additional information about the text you are accessing.

## Technologies Used
Python is used for this mini project, as well as the pyperclip, re, textblob, and matplotlib libraries. The pyperclip library is used to obtain the text on the clipboard of the user. The re library is used to preform regex to remove punctuation from the text. The textblob library is used to preform the sentiment analysis of the text. Matplotlib is used to create the graph to display the frequencies.
